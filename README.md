# chessgame
Attempt at a chess engine. 
The purpose of the project is playing around with different ideas of how to make a chess game. 
It is a goal to find solutions based on programming needs and not look up existing games and implementations. For instance how to solve the chess grid, moving pieces etc.

Future features:
* Users, profiles, history etc. Need server implementation, which will not be prioritized initially.
* Try to make an analyzing tool
* Implement Stockfish or similar.
